# What is the quality of Public Schools in Massachusetts?

## Major Findings

#### Massachusetts schools may be failing some of our most vulnerable students

Higher percentages of African American, Hispanic  or economically disadvantaged students is correlated with lower rates of 
passing scores on state testing in Massachusetts public schools. Smaller class sizes, higher per pupil spending (both in 
and out of district), and higher teacher salaries may help struggling schools. These factors are correlated with higher 
percents of students achieving passing scores on the MCAS (state test). Schools in the greater Boston suburbs generally have
higher rates of students meeting or achieving expectations on the MCAS while schools in urban areas tend not to do as well.

## Background Information

The MCAS (Massachhusetts Comprehensive Assessment System) is a statewide student
assessment initiated as part of the Education Reform Act of 1993. The MCAS are 
administered between 3rd and 10th grade in subjects including math, reading 
comprehension, language arts, and science. Students must pass the MCAS in Math, 
ELA (english language arts) and in a science subject to graduate from High School.

In recent years, Massachusetts has realized MCAS were not meeting state goals. 
The state is in the process of switching to new standards. In this app, tests 
before High School were administered under the old system. These tests are scored 
with four levels: Exceeds Expectations, Meets Expectations, Partially Meets 
Expecations and Not Meeting Expectations. The old system, under which the High 
School tests were administed, used different scoring. Students were classified 
as Advanced, Proficient, Needs Improvement, and Warning and Failing. In this app 
the old scores were mapped to the new ones.

## Data Source

All data used in this project was collected from the Massachussetts Department of 
Education. Test scores are from Spring 2018 testing. School demographics information 
is from the 2016-2017 school year, as this is the most recent available data.

This project was developed for a class at Harvard University, Gov 1005: Data.
